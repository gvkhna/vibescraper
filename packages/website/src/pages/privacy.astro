            A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection,

            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications

            respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
            communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
